Q. What is apache spark?

Apache spark is :-
1. General purpose
2. In memory
3. Compute engine

Q. What hadoop provides?

Hadoop provides :- 
1. Storage - HDFS
2. Computing - MapReduce
3. Resource Manager - YARN

Spark in only alternative or replacement of MapRduce and not replacement for hole Hadoop.

Spark is a plug and play compute engine which needs 2 things to work
1. Storage - (Any - HDFS, AWS S3, Azure blob, Azure ADLS Gen2, GCP cloud)
2. Resource Manager - (Any - YARN, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes)

Current industry trend - HDFS, Spark, YARN

Q. What is in-memory?

It takes input once and compute that input internally in memory and final output print it to the disk. So in the in-memory we have single read and write.

In MapReduce we encounter with disk read and write many times. Due to frequent read and writes to the disk MR is 10 to 100X slower than Spark.
